                    The best teachers are those who show you where to look but don’t tell you what to see” – Alexandra K. Trenfor. 

Mrs. Chitra Raghavan started her illustrious teaching career in the year 1992 as PGT in Physics. An M.Phil in Nuclear Physics, from the University of Madras, her first stint as Principal was for a period of 9 years before she joined D.A.V. Boys Gopalapuram in the year 2005 as PGT (Physics). With her signature teaching style of systematic and rigorous schedule, learning by doing and experiential learning method, she has always encouraged students to give their best and the best they did give – with an impressive record of 87% of students scoring A1 and A2 on an average in Class XII Board Examination in Physics, every year. She is a visionary who believes that ‘The Child is father of the Man’ and the values and personality a child develops in his formative years, mould his mettle and escort him for the rest of his life.

In her words,

“A teacher can never tell where his or her influence stops – it can affect eternity. We, at D.A.V., believe that every child is unique, special and needs an individual approach, no similar to another. A child’s growth is not in measure of his curricular performance or co-curricular excellence, but is in a holistic development that guides and supports him for the rest of his life. The attitude he carries with him determines the altitude he reaches in life.

Do not educate a child to be rich, educate him to be happy. So, when he grows up, he will know the value of things, not the price. We, at D.A.V., strongly believe that gratitude is a quality that must be nurtured in every child as he grows so that he learns to count his blessings every single day. To achieve these objectives, the journey we undertake is long and comes with its own challenges, bends and turns and the role of a parent in this journey is also indispensible.

To raise a child who is comfortable enough to leave you means that you have done your job. They are not ours to keep but to soar high on their own. In this, I believe that parents and teachers are allies who should work together for the fulfillment of their common objective – well being of the child. A parent is equally responsible in fostering morality in a child as a teacher is. A child should appreciate what he has, realize how blessed he is, utilize the God-sent opportunities in a productive manner and reap the benefits. The bent of the mind of a child, his abilities and inclination must always be given foremost priority while taking crucial decisions in his life.

In conclusion, with the grace of the Almighty, blessings of our founding fathers Maharishi Dayanand Saraswati and Mahatma Hansraj and many other torchbearers of the egalitarian principles of our school who have led the mission and vision of D.A.V. till date, the never-ending trust and support of our parents, we march forward towards greater glory, farther destination, to continue this responsibility of producing patriotic and responsible citizens of our nation. “
